# 🌱 Automatic Drip Irrigation System (IoT)

An automated irrigation system built using IoT sensors to monitor soil moisture and control water flow.
This project helps conserve water and protects plants from damage caused by over-watering.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Automatic Drip Irrigation System** uses a **soil moisture sensor**, **Arduino**, and **relay module** to automatically turn the water supply ON or OFF based on moisture levels.
It continuously monitors soil conditions and maintains optimal moisture without manual intervention.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The soil moisture sensor continuously reads moisture levels.
2. If moisture falls **below threshold**, the **relay turns ON** and activates the water pump.
3. Once the soil becomes sufficiently moist, the **relay turns OFF**, stopping the water flow.
4. This cycle helps maintain ideal soil conditions automatically.
